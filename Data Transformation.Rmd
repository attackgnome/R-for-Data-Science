## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

## 5.2.4 Exercise solutions

1. Find all flights that
  a. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
  b. Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
  c. Were operated by United, American, or Delta
  d. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  e. Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
  f. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes     in flight
  g.Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
  
2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
  
  *It for the syntax `between(x, limit1, limit2)` it filters on element x between limit1 and limit2 inclusively.
  
  ** see exercise 1.d and 1.g for examples this construct in use

```{r exercise_1a, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >=120)
```

```{r exercise_1b, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")
```

```{r exercise_1c, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(carrier == "UA" | carrier == "AA"| carrier == "DL")
```


```{r exercise_1d, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(between(month, 7,9))
```

```{r exercise_1e, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <=0)
```

```{r exercise_1f, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay >= 60 & (dep_delay - arr_delay) >30)
```


```{r exercise_1g, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(between(dep_time, 0, 600))
```


3. How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

They may represent flights that never departed due to cancellations.

```{r exercise_3, echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))%>%
  summarize(n = n())
```
4. Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing? Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)

The general rule is that whenever there is a logical expressions, if one can be tested, then the result shouldn't be `NA`. And any operation that the results is determined, regardless of the number, the inputting `NA` does not affect the result.
